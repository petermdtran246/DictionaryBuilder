# Dictionary Builder

I. Description

This repository contains a Python program (main.py) that implements a function to build a word frequency dictionary from a list of words. The program then sorts and displays the dictionary contents by key value.

II. Task

Implement the build_dictionary() function to construct a word frequency dictionary from the given list of words. The main code takes input, splits it into a list of words, calls build_dictionary() to create the dictionary, and then displays the dictionary sorted by key.

III. Usage

To use the program, simply run main.py. The program will prompt you to input a list of words. After input, it will display the word frequency dictionary sorted by key.
